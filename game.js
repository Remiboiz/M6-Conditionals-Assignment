// Prompt user for a number between 1 and 10, or type 999 to exit.

// Create while loop that continues for as long as the user guesses are incorrect.
// Loop should count the number of guesses.
// Loop should exit if user enters 999 and not display "Too high!"
// If the guess is too low, the user should be promped "Too low!" and be able to guess again.
// If the guess is too high, the user should be promped 'Too high!" and be able to guess again.
// If anything else is entered, the user should be prompted that their input is invalid and 
// to guess again.

// If the guess is correct, the user should be alerted of their win and 
// be told the number of guesses they made.
